# library-project

## Description
- This is a project meant to showcase my understanding of advanced JavsScript concenpts such as DOM manipulation, localStorage, and utilizing constructors to contain and manipulate data across the application.

## Goal
- My long-term goal is to use the logic of this specific project to create a long-standing framework of my own, build components on that framework, and turn it into reusable chunks of code for future projects to simplify building.
